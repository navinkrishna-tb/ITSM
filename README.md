# ITSM
### Business Problem:

ABC tech needs improvement on their current IT Service Management. Upgrading the existing ITIL is not an option due to budgetary constraints. So ML becomes the alternative solution.
Key Requirements possible through ML:
1. #### Identifying the priority of incoming Incidents:  
    Incidents are events that interrupts normal service.Higher priority incidents will cause huge economic losses 
    if not handled urgently. So identifying the priority beforehand ensures the optimized usage of the service desk.  
2. #### Forecasting Incident Volume:    
     Forecasting the trend of incident volume to the next year will help ABC tech in preparing their service resources. Decisons regarding recruiting new staffs or improving server capablities can be taken early if the projections look to overload the existing infrastructure
3. #### Improving Customer Satisfaction:  
   Giving an estimated handle time for the customer soon after they registered a ticket will have a positive impact on the customer.
